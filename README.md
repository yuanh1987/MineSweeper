# MineSweeper
Codecademy Unit 1 Project

To play Minesweeper, we will create instances of MineSweeperGame in command line.
For example:
In the command line, navigate to the lib directory and run `node`
Run `.load game.js` to load the contents of this file.
Then create a Game instance and run commands like so:
let game = new Game(3, 3, 3);
game.playMove(0, 1);
game.playMove(1, 2);
When done run `.exit`
